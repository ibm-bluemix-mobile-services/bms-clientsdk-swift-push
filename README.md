This is the Push component of the Swift SDK for [IBM Bluemix Mobile Services](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/mobile/index.html).


##Contents

This package contains the Push components of the Swift SDK.
* Push Registration and Unregister
* Subscribing and Unsubscribing for Tags

##Requirements

* iOS 8.0+
* Xcode 7.3, 8.0
* Swift 2.2 - 3.0

##Installation

The Bluemix Mobile Services Swift SDKs are available via [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/) and [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).

###Cocoapods
To install BMSPush using Cocoapods, add it to your Podfile:

```ruby
use_frameworks!

target 'MyApp' do
    platform :ios, '8.0'
    pod 'BMSCore', '~> 2.0'
    pod 'BMSPush', '~> 2.0'
end
```
From the Terminal, go to your project folder and install the dependencies with the following command:

```
pod install
```

####Swift 2.3

Before running the `pod install` command, make sure to use Cocoapods version [1.1.0.beta.1](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/releases/tag/1.1.0.beta.1).

####Swift 3.0

Before running the `pod install` command, make sure to use Cocoapods version [1.1.0.beta.1](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/releases/tag/1.1.0.beta.1).

For apps built with Swift 3.0, you may receive a prompt saying "Convert to Current Swift Syntax?" when opening your project in Xcode 8 (following the installation of BMSCore) do not convert BMSPush, BMSCore or BMSAnalyticsAPI

This will installs your dependencies and creates a new Xcode workspace.
***Note:*** Ensure that you always open the new Xcode workspace, instead of the original Xcode project file:

```
MyApp.xcworkspace
```

###Carthage
To install BMSPush using Carthage, add it to your Cartfile:

```
github "ibm-bluemix-mobile-services/bms-clientsdk-swift-push"
```

Then run the `carthage update` command. Once the build is finished, drag `BMSPush.framework`,`BMSCore.framework` and `BMSAnalyticsAPI.framework` into your Xcode project.

To complete the integration, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#getting-started).

####Xcode 8

For apps built with Swift 2.3, use the command `carthage update --toolchain com.apple.dt.toolchain.Swift_2_3.` Otherwise, use `carthage update`

##Enabling iOS applications to receive push notifications

###Reference the SDK in your code.

```
import BMSPush
import BMSCore
```
###Initializing the Core SDK

```
let myBMSClient = BMSClient.sharedInstance

//Swift3

myBMSClient.initialize(bluemixRegion: "Location where your app Hosted")

//Swift 2.3 or Older

myBMSClient.initialize(bluemixRegion: "Location where your app Hosted")

myBMSClient.defaultRequestTimeout = 10.0 // Timeout in seconds

```

#####bluemixRegion

- Specifies the location where the app hosted. You can use one of three values - `BMSClient.Region.usSouth`, `BMSClient.Region.unitedKingdom` and `BMSClient.Region.sydney`.

###Initializing the Push SDK

 initialize the `BMSPushClient`  using the following code.
```
let push =  BMSPushClient.sharedInstance

//Swift 3

push.initializeWithAppGUID(appGUID: "your push appGUID", clientSecret:"your push client secret")

//Swift Older

push.initializeWithAppGUID(appGUID:"your push appGUID", clientSecret:"your push client secret")

```

#####appGUID

- The Push app GUID value.

#####clientSecret

- The Push client secret value.

###Registering iOS applications and devices

Add this code to registering the app for push notification in APNS,

```

let settings = UIUserNotificationSettings(forTypes: [.Alert, .Badge, .Sound], categories: nil)
UIApplication.sharedApplication().registerUserNotificationSettings(settings)
UIApplication.sharedApplication().registerForRemoteNotifications()

//For iOS 10

 UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(options: [.alert, .sound, .badge])
 { (granted, error) in

    UIApplication.shared.registerForRemoteNotifications()
 }

```    

>**Note**: If you are using Xcode8 beta, add `yourApp.entitlements`. To do this, go to Targets -> Capabilities and enable Push Notifications capability.

After the token is received from APNS, pass the token to Push Notifications as part of the `didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken` method.

```

//Swift3

 func application (_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data){

   let push =  BMSPushClient.sharedInstance
   push.initializeWithAppGUID(appGUID: "your push App GUID")
   push.registerWithDeviceToken(deviceToken: deviceToken) { (response, statusCode, error) -> Void in
    if error.isEmpty {
      print( "Response during device registration : \(response)")
      print( "status code during device registration : \(statusCode)")
    } else{
      print( "Error during device registration \(error) ")
      Print( "Error during device registration \n  - status code: \(statusCode) \n Error :\(error) \n")
    }  
 }


 //Swift2.3 and Older

 func application (application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: NSData){

   let push =  BMSPushClient.sharedInstance
   push.initializeWithAppGUID("your push App GUID")
   push.registerWithDeviceToken(deviceToken) { (response, statusCode, error) -> Void in
        if error.isEmpty {
            print( "Response during device registration : \(response)")
            print( "status code during device registration : \(statusCode)")
        }else{
            print( "Error during device registration \(error) ")
            Print( "Error during device registration \n  - status code: \(statusCode) \n Error :\(error) \n")
        }
    }
}
```

###Registering iOS applications and devices with userId

For `userId` based notification, the register method will accept one more parameter - `userId`


```
//Swift3

func application (_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data){

   let push =  BMSPushClient.sharedInstance
   push.initializeWithAppGUID(appGUID: "your push App GUID", clientSecret:"your pushApp Client Secret")
   push.registerWithDeviceToken(deviceToken: deviceToken, WithUserId: "your userId") { (response, statusCode, error) -> Void in
    if error.isEmpty {
      print( "Response during device registration : \(response)")
      print( "status code during device registration : \(statusCode)")
    } else{
      print( "Error during device registration \(error) ")
      Print( "Error during device registration \n  - status code: \(statusCode) \n Error :\(error) \n")
    }  
}

//Swift2.3 and Older

func application (application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: NSData){

    let push =  BMSPushClient.sharedInstance
    push.initializeWithAppGUID("your push App GUID", clientSecret:"your pushApp Client Secret")
    push.registerWithDeviceToken(deviceToken, WithUserId: "your userId") { (response, statusCode, error) -> Void in
        if error.isEmpty {
            print( "Response during device registration : \(response)")
            print( "status code during device registration : \(statusCode)")
        }else{
            print( "Error during device registration \(error) ")
            Print( "Error during device registration \n  - status code: \(statusCode) \n Error :\(error) \n")
        }
    }
}
```

#####WithUserId

- The User Id value you want to register in the push service

>**Note**: If userId is provided the client secret value must be provided.


###Retrieve Available Tags and subscribe for Tags based Notifications

#####Retrieve Available tags

The `retrieveAvailableTagsWithCompletionHandler` API returns the list of available tags to which the device
can subscribe. After the device is subscribed to a particular tag, the device can receive any push notifications
that are sent for that tag.Call the push service to get subscriptions for a tag.

Copy the following code snippets into your Swift mobile application to get a list of available tags to which the
device can subscribe.

```

//Swift3

push.retrieveAvailableTagsWithCompletionHandler(completionHandler: { (response, statusCode, error) -> Void in

  if error.isEmpty {
    print( "Response during retrieve tags : \(response)")
    print( "status code during retrieve tags : \(statusCode)")
  }else{
    print( "Error during retrieve tags \(error) ")
    Print( "Error during retrieve tags \n  - status code: \(statusCode) \n Error :\(error) \n")
  }
}

//Swift2.3 and Older

push.retrieveAvailableTagsWithCompletionHandler({ (response, statusCode, error) -> Void in

    if error.isEmpty {
        print( "Response during retrieve tags : \(response)")
        print( "status code during retrieve tags : \(statusCode)")
    }else{
        print( "Error during retrieve tags \(error) ")
        Print( "Error during retrieve tags \n  - status code: \(statusCode) \n Error :\(error) \n")
    }
}
```
#####Subscribe to Available tags

```

//Swift3

 push.subscribeToTags(tagsArray: response!, completionHandler: { (response, statusCode, error) -> Void in

   if error.isEmpty {
       print( "Response during Subscribing to tags : \(response?.description)")     
       print( "status code during Subscribing tags : \(statusCode)")
     }else{
       print( "Error during subscribing tags \(error) ")
       Print( "Error during subscribing tags \n  - status code: \(statusCode) \n Error :\(error) \n")
     }
 }

//Swift2.3 and Older

push.subscribeToTags(response, completionHandler: { (response, statusCode, error) -> Void in

    if error.isEmpty {
        print( "Response during Subscribing to tags : \(response?.description)")
        print( "status code during Subscribing tags : \(statusCode)")
    }else {
        print( "Error during subscribing tags \(error) ")
        Print( "Error during subscribing tags \n  - status code: \(statusCode) \n Error :\(error) \n")
    }
}
```

#####Retrieve Subscribed tags

```

//Swift3
 push.retrieveSubscriptionsWithCompletionHandler(completionHandler: { (response, statusCode, error) -> Void in

   if error.isEmpty {                                     
     print( "Response during retrieving subscribed tags : \(response?.description)")
     print( "status code during retrieving subscribed tags : \(statusCode)")
   }else{
     print( "Error during retrieving subscribed tags \(error) ")
     Print( "Error during retrieving subscribed tags \n  - status code: \(statusCode) \n Error :\(error) \n")
   }
 }

//Swift2.3 and Older
push.retrieveSubscriptionsWithCompletionHandler { (response, statusCode, error) -> Void in

    if error.isEmpty {
        print( "Response during retrieving subscribed tags : \(response?.description)")
        print( "status code during retrieving subscribed tags : \(statusCode)")
    }else {
        print( "Error during retrieving subscribed tags \(error) ")
        Print( "Error during retrieving subscribed tags \n  - status code: \(statusCode) \n Error :\(error) \n")
    }
}
```
###Unsubscribing from tags based notifications

Use the following code snippets to allow your devices to get unsubscribe
from a tag.

```

//Swift3
push.unsubscribeFromTags(tagsArray: response!, completionHandler: { (response, statusCode, error) -> Void in

  if error.isEmpty {
    print( "Response during unsubscribed tags : \(response?.description)")
    print( "status code during unsubscribed tags : \(statusCode)")
  }else{
    print( "Error during  unsubscribed tags \(error) ")
  }
}

//Swift2.3 and Older

push.unsubscribeFromTags(response, completionHandler: { (response, statusCode, error) -> Void in

    if error.isEmpty {

        print( "Response during unsubscribed tags : \(response?.description)")

        print( "status code during unsubscribed tags : \(statusCode)")
    }
    else {
        print( "Error during  unsubscribed tags \(error) ")

        print( "Error during unsubscribed tags \n  - status code: \(statusCode) \n Error :\(error) \n")
    }
}
```
###Unregistering the Device from Bluemix Push Notification

Use the following code snippets to Unregister the device from Bluemix Push Notification

```

//Swift3

push.unregisterDevice(completionHandler: { (response, statusCode, error) -> Void in

  if error.isEmpty {                 
     print( "Response during unregistering device : \(response)")
     print( "status code during unregistering device : \(statusCode)")
   }else{
     print( "Error during unregistering device \(error) ")
   }
}

//Swift2.3 and Older

push.unregisterDevice({ (response, statusCode, error) -> Void in

    if error.isEmpty {
        print( "Response during unregistering device : \(response)")
        print( "status code during unregistering device : \(statusCode)")
    }else{
        print( "Error during unregistering device \(error) ")
