This is the Push component of the Swift SDK for IBM Bluemix Mobile Services. 

https://console.ng.bluemix.net/solutions/mobilefirst


## Contents

This package contains the Push components of the Swift SDK.
* Push Registration
* Subscribing and Unsubcribing for Tags


## Requirements

* iOS 8.0+ 
* Xcode 7


## Installation

The Bluemix Mobile Services Swift SDKs are available via [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/) and [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).


#### Cocoapods
To install BMSCore using Cocoapods, add it to your Podfile:

```ruby
use_frameworks!

target 'MyApp' do
    platform :ios, '8.0'
    pod 'BMSCore'
    pod 'BMSPush'
end
```
From the Terminal, go to your project folder and install the dependencies with the following command:

```
pod install
```

That command installs your dependencies and creates a new Xcode workspace.
***Note:*** Ensure that you always open the new Xcode workspace, instead of the original Xcode project file:

```
open App.xcworkspace
```


#### Carthage
To install BMSPush using Carthage, add it to your Cartfile: 

```ogdl
github "ibm-bluemix-mobile-services/bms-clientsdk-swift-push"
```

Then run the `carthage update` command. Once the build is finished, drag `BMSPush.framework`,`BMSCore.framework` and `BMSAnalyticsAPI.framework` into your Xcode project. 

To complete the integration, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#getting-started).

## Enabling iOS applications to receive push notifications

##### Reference the SDK in your code.

```
import BMSPush
import BMSCore
```
#### Initializing the Core SDK

```
let myBMSClient = BMSClient.sharedInstance

myBMSClient.initializeWithBluemixAppRoute("BluemixAppRoute", bluemixAppGUID: "APPGUID", bluemixRegion:"Location where your app Hosted")
myBMSClient.defaultRequestTimeout = 10.0 // Timput in seconds

```
***AppRoute***

Specifies the route that is assigned to the server application that you created on Bluemix.

***AppGUID***

Specifies the unique key that is assigned to the application that you created on Bluemix. This value is 
case-sensitive.

***bluemixRegionSuffix***

Specifies the location where the app hosted. You can use one of three values - `BMSClient.REGION_US_SOUTH`, `BMSClient.REGION_UK` and `BMSClient.REGION_SYDNEY`.

#### Initializing the Push SDK

```
let push =  BMSPushClient.sharedInstance
```

#### Registering iOS applications and devices

Add this code to registering the app for push notification in APNS,

```
let settings = UIUserNotificationSettings(forTypes: [.Alert, .Badge, .Sound], categories: nil)
UIApplication.sharedApplication().registerUserNotificationSettings(settings)
UIApplication.sharedApplication().registerForRemoteNotifications()
```    
After the token is received from APNS, pass the token to Push Notifications as part of the
 ***didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken*** method.

```
 func application (application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: NSData){

    let push =  BMSPushClient.sharedInstance
   push.registerDeviceToken(deviceToken) { (response, statusCode, error) -> Void in
            
        if error.isEmpty {

            print( "Response during device registration : \(response)")
                
            print( "status code during device registration : \(statusCode)")
        }
        else{
            print( "Error during device registration \(error) ")
                
            Print( "Error during device registration \n  - status code: \(statusCode) \n Error :\(error) \n")
        }
    }

}
```
#### Retrieve Available Tags and register for Tags

##### Retrieve Available tags

The ***retrieveAvailableTagsWithCompletionHandler*** API returns the list of available tags to which the device
can subscribe. After the device is subscribed to a particular tag, the device can receive any push notifications
that are sent for that tag.

Call the push service to get subscriptions for a tag.

Copy the following code snippets into your Swift mobile application to get a list of available tags to which the
device can subscribe.

```
push.retrieveAvailableTagsWithCompletionHandler({ (response, statusCode, error) -> Void in
                    
    if error.isEmpty {
        
        print( "Response during retrieve tags : \(response)")
        
        print( "status code during retrieve tags : \(statusCode)")
    }
    else{
        print( "Error during retrieve tags \(error) ")
        
        Print( "Error during retrieve tags \n  - status code: \(statusCode) \n Error :\(error) \n")
    }
}
```
##### Subscribe to Available tags

```
push.subscribeToTags(response, completionHandler: { (response, statusCode, error) -> Void in
                            
    if error.isEmpty {
        
        print( "Response during Subscribing to tags : \(response?.description)")

        print( "status code during Subscribing tags : \(statusCode)")
    }
    else {
                                
        print( "Error during subscribing tags \(error) ")
        
        Print( "Error during subscribing tags \n  - status code: \(statusCode) \n Error :\(error) \n")
    }
}
```

##### Retrieve Subscribed tags

```
push.retrieveSubscriptionsWithCompletionHandler { (response, statusCode, error) -> Void in
            
    if error.isEmpty {
        
        print( "Response during retrieving subscribed tags : \(response?.description)")

        print( "status code during retrieving subscribed tags : \(statusCode)")
    }
    else {
        
        print( "Error during retrieving subscribed tags \(error) ")
        
        Print( "Error during retrieving subscribed tags \n  - status code: \(statusCode) \n Error :\(error) \n")
    }
}
```
#### unsubscribing tags

Use the following code snippets to allow your devices to get unsubscribe
from a tag.

```
push.unsubscribeFromTags(response, completionHandler: { (response, statusCode, error) -> Void in
                    
    if error.isEmpty {
        
        print( "Response during unsubscribed tags : \(response?.description)")

        print( "status code during unsubscribed tags : \(statusCode)")
    }
    else {
        print( "Error during  unsubscribed tags \(error) ")
        
        print( "Error during unsubscribed tags \n  - status code: \(statusCode) \n Error :\(error) \n")
    }
}
```
#### Unregistering the Device from Bluemix Push Notification

Use the following code snippets to Unregister the device from Bluemix Push Notification

```
push.unregisterDevice({ (response, statusCode, error) -> Void in
                            
    if error.isEmpty {
        
        print( "Response during unregistering device : \(response)")
        
        print( "status code during unregistering device : \(statusCode)")
    }
    else{
        print( "Error during unregistering device \(error) ")
        
        print( "Error during unregistering device \n  - status code: \(statusCode) \n Error :\(error) \n")
    }
}
```
###Known Limitations
Currently Swift SDK does not submit monitoring data. This is a work in progress and will be delivered in following months. If youâ€™d like to continue receiving monitoring data in the service dashboard you can continue using Objective-C SDK.
